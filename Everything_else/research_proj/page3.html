                <p>Referring back to the raising of GPU temperatures: GPU’s heat up often when significant levels of processing are drawn. However, GPU’s should not change in temperature too drastically to avoid hardware malfunction; as a solution, hardware cooling components are often implemented in machines to avoid processors getting too overheated. <br><br>Water cooling is a popular method of cooling machine processors for LLM’s specifically. Unfortunately, this cooling method requires constant, non-cycling supplies of freshwater for each an every GPU. As a result, investigations have shown that generative AI models use up to 700,000 gallons of water, just in training alone– all of which is freshwater. <a href="sources.html">[4]</a>  The usage of freshwater already has present-day impacts, as civilians in South America have come to protest against Google over the depletion of their freshwater resources. <a href="sources.html">[5]</a> </p>
